# Plan for the afternoon

- Show you a little of what **Shiny** can do

- Either you can do more yourself 

- Or you can find something that will be useful for your business in the future

- There are many alternatives: *Tableau* and *Microsoft Power BI* to name just two.


---
# R

- Open source statistical software

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) is an IDE that helps make `R` easier to use

- **Shiny** is an add on package turns `R` code into web applications.

--

- My experience with Shiny:

- Build shiny apps for both internal and external use

    - External: Online calculators/models/teaching tools

    - Internal: Automated Reporting/Disease Mapping 

---
# Today

- Quick general intro

- Building **Shiny apps**

- Interactive plots

- Controlling User input

- Reactivity

--

- Some apps to work with (and others for later)

- An app for you to build using what we've looked at

---
# Some `R` Basics


- `R` statistical programming language

- Code based, write code files and run them

- Very flexible, interactive and no compilation needed

---
# Some `R` Basics

- Some example code:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
prime <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11) # save with <-
prime                      # print
```

```{r, eval = TRUE}
mean(prime)
length(prime)
prime / 2                  # vectorised!
```

---
# Some `R` Basics

or we can plot things

```{r, eval = TRUE, fig.height = 4, dev = 'svg', fig.align = "center"}
some_data <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 0, sd = 1) # normal dist.
hist(some_data, main = "Histogram") 
```


---
# Some `R` Basics

- Can add functionality with **packages**

- **Shiny** is one of those packages.

```{r}
library(shiny) # load packages using library(...)
```

--

- We'll also be using the [plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) package

--

- **Shiny** is a little different to normal `R` code.

--

- Normal `R` code gets run line by line. Edit, Run, Edit, Run ... 

- **Shiny** gets run pretty much all at once and doesn't stop running until you tell it to. 

- **Shiny** lets you change inputs $\rightarrow$ reruns code.

# Shiny

# Shiny

- A **Shiny** app has two main parts: **ui** and **server**

- **ui** controls the *user interface*

- **server** works behind the scenes

--

- Let's start with an example

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Let's Get Started

### Open RStudio and we'll run our first app


---
# Opening an App

```{r, out.width = "100%", eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RStudio.png")
```

---
# App01 Histogram

- Click **Run App**.

- Move the slider, what happens?

--

- Let's look at things in a bit more detail

---
# A Shiny App

Single `app.R` file

```{r}
# load packages
library(shiny)

# Define what the user sees
ui <- fluidPage(
  # what the user sees
)

# Define server logic required to sort data and draw plot
server <- function(input, output) {
  # what actually does the work behind the scenes
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

---
# A Shiny App

Concentrate on **ui** and **server**

```{r}
# Define what the user sees
ui <- fluidPage(
  # what the user sees
)

# Define server logic required to sort data and draw plot
server <- function(input, output) {
  # what actually does the work behind the scenes
}

```


---
# A Shiny App

```{r}
# Define what the user sees
ui <- fluidPage(
  # Sidebar with input for user to control 
  sidebarLayout( 
    sidebarPanel( 
      sliderInput(label = "Number of Points", inputId = "points", #<<
                  min = 1, max = 10000, value = 500) #<<
    ), 
    # Show the generated plot 
    mainPanel(plotOutput("Plot")) #<<
  )
)
```


---
# A Shiny App

```{r}
# Define server logic required to sort data and draw plot
server <- function(input, output) {
  # generate plot
  output$Plot <- renderPlot({ 
    # gather info from user
    num_points <- input$points  #<<
    
    # create data
    data_to_plot <- data.frame(x = rnorm(num_points))   #<<
    
    # create plot
    hist(data_to_plot$x, main = "Histogram")    #<<
  })
}
```


---
# A Shiny App

```{r}
# Define what the user sees
ui <- fluidPage(
  # Sidebar with input for user to control 
  sidebarLayout(  
    sidebarPanel( 
      sliderInput(label = "Number of Points", inputId = "points", #<<
                  min = 1, max = 10000, value = 500) #<<
    ),
    # Show the generated plot
    mainPanel(plotOutput("Plot")) #<<
  )
)

# Define server logic required to sort data and draw plot
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$Plot <- renderPlot({  #<< 
    # gather info from user
    num_points <- input$points  #<<
    # ... 
  })  
}
```

---
# App01 Histogram

- Right back to the app we opened earlier... 

- **Exercise** 

Change the minimum value of the slider to 100 and the starting value to 1000

---
class: center, middle

# Plotly

---
# Plotly

- Whilst the app is interactive the plot isn't

- **Plotly** gives us a quick way to add interactivity

    - Lots of actions built in (tooltips, zoom, export)

    - Can customise much of it (not going to look at that here)

- We need to make a few changes to the app

---
# App02 Plotly Histogram

Some new things (for the most part replacing `plot` with `plot_ly`)

```{r}
# load the new package
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
# change the output type slightly
mainPanel(plotlyOutput("Plot"))
```

```{r}
# change the render type slightly
output$Plot <- renderPlotly({ ... })
```

```{r}
# change the plotting function
plot_ly(data_to_plot, x = ~x, type = "histogram")
```

--

- **Exercise** 

Change the name **Shiny** uses for the plot to *Plotly*. Where do you need to make the changes?

Feel free to make other changes too.

---
# Plotly Commands and Data Storage

- Before we go much further let's just look at that `plotly` command. 

- We give it a dataset, tell it which columns to use for the axes, and the plot type.

```{r}
plot_ly(data = ..., x = ~x_column, y = ~y_column, type = "...", 
        ...)
```

--

- We're going to use data stored in two formats today: 

    - Data frame (like a single Excel Spreadsheet)
    
    - Vectors (like a single column/row of Excel Spreadsheet)

- Later we'll look at reading in our own data.

- Now another type of plot.

---
# App03 Scatterplot

- Uses `plotly` and a built in dataset - `diamonds`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
head(diamonds)
```

---
# App03 Scatterplot

- Uses `plotly` and a built in dataset - `diamonds`.

- Slider controls number of points to plot.

- Before you move the slider, what do you expect to happen.

- Try zooming in and then mouseover individual point. Can you reset the plot?

--

- **Exercise** 

Instead of colouring by *cut*, use the variable *clarity*. 

---
# App 04 Two Inputs

- Now we can add another input

- `selectizeInput()` allows more than one value

- Change the *cut* selection and change the slider - what happens?

--

- **Exercise** 

Change the maximum value of the slider to `nrow(diamonds)` so we can plot all the data. 

Can you change the minimum value too - say a quarter of all the data?

--

- **Advanced Exercise** 

We have some repetition in the app. Create a vector of choices and replace the vectors in `selectizeInput()` with it. Where should it go? 
**Hint:** 

```{r}
cut_choices <- c("Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal")
```



---
# App 05 Boxplot

- Keeping the two inputs we can use boxplots instead.

- **Note:** You'll see that we have changed the `x = ~... ` to a category.

```{r}
# draw boxplots
plot_ly(data = diamonds_to_plot, x = ~cut, y = ~price, color = ~cut,
        type = "box")
```

--

- **Exercise** 

What would happen if you remove `color = ~cut`? Find out. Can you change the default single colour? *Hint: `color = I("pink")`*. 

---
# App 06 Choose Plots

- Alternatively we can let the user choose how to display the data.

- We now have another input - `selectInput()` and an `if()` statement

```{r}
# draw correct plot
if (input$plot_type == "Boxplots") { #<<
  # draw boxplots
  plot_ly(data = diamonds_to_plot, x = ~cut, y = ~price, 
          color = ~cut, type = "box")
} else {  #<<
  # draw scatterplot
  plot_ly(data = diamonds_to_plot, x = ~carat, y = ~price, 
          color = ~cut, type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
  
} #<<
```

--

- **Exercise** 

Change the order so that the code checks if `input$plot_type == "Scatterplot"` it draws a scatterplot `else` it draws a boxplot.

# Reactivity

## A Quick Aside

---
# Reactivity

- Was the last app well designed? 

- What if you wanted to change the type of chart *and* the cut *and* the number of points?

- How many graphs did it draw?

--

- Unless told otherwise **shiny** listens all the time.

- We need to `isolate()` the bits we don't want to listen too.

---
# App 07 Reactivity

- Have changed the inputs to

```{r}
# gather info from user but only when asked
num_diamonds <- isolate(input$diamonds)
types_cut <- isolate(input$cut)

# listen to go button
input$go
```

- **Note:** The type of chart is not isolated - chart type will change straight away.

--

- **Exercise** 

`isolate()` the type of chart and/or remove the isolation from something else. 

---
# App 08 Reading in Data

- Last thing we're going to look at today (before trying one yourself) is doing this with your own data.

- Ideally in *csv* format and rectangular (with column names without spaces)

- Load `readr` package and use `read_csv("filename.csv)`.

```{r}
library(readr)
weather <- read_csv("weather.csv")
head(weather)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
weather <- read_csv("exercise_app/weather.csv")
head(weather)
```

---
# App 08 Reading in Data

- Read in **weather** data and use as we did with **diamonds**.

- Now using the `sliderInput()` but with **2** values. This creates two slider values to move. 

```{r}
sliderInput(...,min = min(weather$year), max = max(weather$year),
            value= c(min(weather$year), max(weather$year))) 
```

- Filtering the data `between()` years based on slider values.

```{r}
filter(weather, between(year, left = min(slider_years), 
                        right = max(slider_years)))
```

--

- **Exercise** 

Add some code to the `plot_ly()` command to change the colour of the boxplot depending on the *location*.

---
class: center, middle

# Your turn ... 

---
# Your Turn

- Open the `exercise_app` folder and then `app.R`.

- Feel free to copy and paste code from earlier apps.

- Start with **Task 1** and then feel free to try the others or work on anything else you'd like.

- Please ask questions

---
# Your Turn

- **Task 1**: Read in `weather.csv` and create boxplots of *rain* for each location. *You can copy and paste a lot of code from app 08 - just need to change a few things.*

- **Task 2**: Add a `selectizeInput()` to choose location.

- **Task 3**: Add an additional plot. *rain* vs *date* as a *scatterplot*. 

    - Two possibilities here: Add a dropdown for the different plots as we did in app 06 or

    - You can add another plot below the first

```{r}
mainPanel(plotlyOutput("plot1"), plotlyOutput("plot2"))
```

- **Task 4**: `isolate()` some/all the inputs. If you are isolating anything you wil need to add a **go** button (or similar) like we did in app 07.

- **Task 5**: By investigating the extra apps, try to display the two plots in different tabs.

# Next Steps

---
# More Apps ... 

There are many other ways to display shiny apps. I have created some additional apps. In the *extras* folder:

- `tabs`: Uses a different tab for each plot

- `tabs_reactive`: Similar to `tabs` but it removes a lot of repetitive code

- `shiny_documents`: A **shiny** presentation and report

There are also several Shiny showcases

- [Shiny Demos](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#demos)

- [Shiny User Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/#user-showcase)

And plenty of places to learn a bit more

- Excellent [Short tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/) written by very experienced shiny programmer.

- The book [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/), written by RStudio staff.

# Hosting/Deploying

- Shiny apps can be hosted online or deployed internally

- Online

    - shinyapps.io

    - Open source shiny server

    - Shinyproxy (open source with authentication)

- Internal

    - Open source (Behind firewall)

    - Shinyproxy

    - Share the code - like we did here

---
# Summary

- **Shiny** turns `R` code into interactive web app

- **Plotly** automatically adds zoom/tooltip/export/... 

- All open source and reproducible
